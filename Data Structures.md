# Data Structures
## Hash Tables
Consists of:
1. A hashing function
2. An array
3. A linked list

When storing an object, the hashing function is run on the object (e.g. string or number) which produces an integer. This integer represents which index in the array it should be stored.
If collisions occur, a linked list can be created at the array index which can store more objects that collide.

## Array List
Dynamically allocated array

## String Buffer
Stores all strings as an array and outputs (e.g. concatenates strings only when necessary).
